While I did study at some fancy universities and had internships, the truth is I'm still figuring out what I'm doing most of the time. I can copy-paste code from Stack Overflow like a pro, and I've mastered the art of looking busy while debugging the same error for 3 hours. My 'deep understanding' of TypeScript mostly consists of adding 'any' types everywhere until the red squiggles disappear. When I'm not at my computer pretending to be productive, I enjoy cooking (burning) food, watching movies (to avoid coding), and working out (my only real skill). The real secret to my energy? Caffeine and imposter syndrome! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
