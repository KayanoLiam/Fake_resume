# 🤦‍♂️ KayanoJackal's Fake Resume Portfolio

> **Warning**: This is a completely fake portfolio showcasing absolutely zero real skills. Any resemblance to actual competence is purely coincidental.

Welcome to my "professional" portfolio website! This is where I pretend to be a developer while having no actual skills to show. Think of it as performance art, but with more TypeScript errors and existential dread.

## 🎭 What This Actually Is

This is a humorous, self-deprecating portfolio website that openly admits to being fake. Instead of trying to impress potential employers with non-existent skills, it embraces the chaos of being a wannabe developer who:

- Has no real projects (all failures)
- Learned everything from Stack Overflow
- Uses AI for translations because can't actually speak other languages
- Hosts disasters on Vercel for free
- Rickrolls visitors who click the "blog" button

## 🛠️ Built With (Barely)

- **React & Next.js** - Because everyone said I should use them
- **TypeScript** - With lots of `any` types (don't judge)
- **Tailwind CSS** - For when you can't write real CSS
- **Framer Motion** - To make things move and distract from the lack of content
- **next-intl** - For fake multilingual support (all translations by AI)
- **use-sound** - Because clicking buttons should make noise
- **Pure Desperation** - The secret ingredient

## 🎯 Features (If You Can Call Them That)

### 🌍 "Multilingual" Support
- **English**: The only language I actually understand
- **Japanese/French/German**: Completely fake, translated by AI
- Custom popup that admits language learning failure when downloading resume

### 🎵 Sound Effects
- Bubble sounds for hovering (very professional)
- Theme switching sounds (light-on.mp3 / light-off.mp3)
- Because every serious portfolio needs sound effects, right?

### 🌙 Dark/Light Theme
- Toggle between looking unprofessional in light or dark mode
- Animated transitions to hide the lack of real content

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Looks equally amateur on all devices
- Mobile-friendly disappointment

### 🎪 Projects Section
Featuring my greatest failures:
1. **Next Starter** - Failed due to 2018 MacBook Pro issues
2. **JobHunter** - A job platform that became a scammer paradise
3. **SGmusic** - Died when I couldn't afford Cursor subscription
4. **Standard_PyOxidizer** - Overestimated Python knowledge, failed to rewrite standard library in Rust

### 🎯 Easter Eggs
- Blog button leads to Rick Astley (you're welcome)
- Self-deprecating footer with legal disclaimers about having no rights
- Animated emojis that judge your life choices

## 🚀 Getting Started (If You Dare)

```bash
# Clone this disaster
git clone https://github.com/KayanoLiam/Fake_resume.git

# Install dependencies (and my problems)
npm install

# Run the development server (prepare for disappointment)
npm run dev

# Build for production (as if this is production-ready)
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to witness the chaos.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

"If you can't impress them with skill, confuse them with honesty about your lack of skill."

This portfolio follows the revolutionary approach of being completely transparent about incompetence. Instead of fake testimonials and inflated achievements, it offers:

- Brutal honesty about skill level (zero)
- Admission of using AI for everything
- Acknowledgment that all projects failed
- Self-aware humor about the state of modern web development

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? That's not a bug, that's a feature representing my coding ability.

Want to contribute? Please don't. This portfolio is perfectly imperfect as it is.

If you absolutely must:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch with an equally self-deprecating name
3. Make changes that somehow make it worse
4. Submit a PR explaining how your changes increase the chaos

- **Stack Overflow** - For teaching me everything I know (which isn't much)
- **ChatGPT** - For writing code I don't understand
- **Vercel** - For hosting my disasters for free
- **My 2018 MacBook Pro** - For being the perfect excuse for all failures

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

No actual skills were harmed in the making of this website. Any resemblance to real competence is purely coincidental. This portfolio is not intended for serious employment consideration unless you're looking for someone who's really good at admitting they're bad at things.
